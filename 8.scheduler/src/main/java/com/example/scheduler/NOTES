Why Scheduling?
    For execution at hourly basis, daily basis, weekly basis, monthly basis or even some other as well.
    PDF report is one of the best example.

   1. What is Scheduling and where do we use it?
   2. How to Schedule a task and job in Java using Spring boot Scheduler?
   3.Annotations - @EnableScheduling and @Scheduled in scheduling context
   4. different ways(fixed delay, fixed rate, and Cron expressions
   5. Difference between point of time and point of period
   6. Cron expression and how to write it.
   7. various brainStorming Cron Expressions
   8. Check an invalid Cron Expression

1. a) particular time interval, without any human intervention.
   b) particular data or file to any other application in a particular time interval.
   Ex- Monthly bank statements, Salary slips, Insurance payment, Electricity bill, Daily Standup meetings, Sprint plan

2. a) Period of time: A time gap. Doesnt have start or end. Ex-1 hour, 24 minutes.
   b) Point of time: a particular time- ex 4AM

3. @EnableScheduling - class level annotation. for a starter class for schedules.
   @Scheduled - Method level annotation over a scheduling logic.

4. Functionality of @Scheduled?
    Annotation instricts container to execute the method in loop as per parameters provided

    concepts used to support scheduling - fixed delay, fixed rate, cron expression
    These are manadatory paramaetrs for @Scheduling annotation
    Exception - IllegalStateException

    Annotated method mustnot accept parameters and must have a return type.

5. Fixed delay specifies a fixed time interval between scheduling an activity.
    On startup, execution happens, can be delayed using initialDelay paramater
    Bot fixed delay and initiaDelay can be passed as int or String

    @Schedule(fixedDelay = 50)
    @Schedule(initialDelay = 5000)

    Or

    @Schedule(fixedDelayString = 50)
    @Schedule(initialDelayString = 5000)

6. Using fixedRate, specifies a maximum time interval between jobs.
    @Scheduled(fixedRate=50)
    @Scheduled(fixedRateString = 50)

7. Using cron
    There are 6 asterix by default in cron
    Could be assigned as Second, Minute, Hours, Day, Month, WeekDay
    second(0-59) Minute(0-59) Hour(0-59) DayOfMonth(0-31) Month(0-12 or JAN-DEC) DayOfweek(0-7 or MON-SUN)

    A cron symbol can accept symbols: *-,/?
    Comma denotes possible values 004,6*** - execute at 4AM and 6AM (comma saperrated-same fields)
    Dash(-) denotes a range, which means consider al possible values between the range 004-6*** i.e execute at 4AM,5AM and 6AM
    hourly saperation
    * any/every/all value
    /-period of time
    ? denotes any value at Day and WeekDay when month value is given.
    English names can also be used for the day of the month and day of week fields. Use the first three letters of particular
    day or month(case does-not matter)
